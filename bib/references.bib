  abstract = {The information on the web is ever increasing and it is becoming difficult for students to find appropriate information or relevant learning material to satisfy their needs. Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) have emerged in a variety of application areas including in Learning Management Systems (LMS). In the learning field, the main focus is on the learning style and learning behavior of the learners. Identifying learning style and learning behavior helps in the development of learning management systems. Effective Personalized Learning Recommendation Systems will not only reduce this burden of information overload by recommending the relevant learning material of their interest to the students, but also provide them with the "right" information at the "right" time and in the "right" way. Educational Data Mining is an emerging interdisciplinary research area of DM that deals with the development of methods to explore data originating in an educational context. In this paper, we present a novel technique for finding the relevant references, i.e., Most Recently Referred (MRR) and All Time Referred (ATR) titles by students in LMS. The MRR references are obtained using a personalized dynamic sliding window, which is able to adapt its size according to the ratio of references/titles mentioned by students' in the previous semester. The ATR references are obtained by selecting references that represent the interest of a larger number of students in a particular reference over the year(s). This novel approach has helped in incrementally updating the association rules mined from the log files of an LMS database. The experiments and the evaluation of the proposed methods show that the MRR and ATR referred titles are in sync in numbers and, hence, we can explicitly recommend the learning material references by using either of the proposed techniques.},

In this paper we propose a prototype architecture aimed to engineer Open Learning Management Systems, that professes state-of-the-art software engineering techniques such as layered structure and component-based nature. Our work is based upon standards and practices from international standardization bodies, on the empirical results of designing, developing and evaluating Learning Management Systems and on the practices of well-established software engineering techniques.",

  abstract = {Business analysts and human resource executives consider MicroLearning and Gamification as two of the currently hottest topics in corporate learning and workplace learning. MicroLearning is seen as a solution for the limitations in dedicated learning time of employees, already stressed in their daily work routines. Gamification fosters users engagement and creates higher intrinsic motivation to learn. In this case study, we report and analyze the learning behavior of 175 employees using gamified MicroLearning over the course of seven months. The study setup allows observing behavior with and without the extrinsic motivation of an employee competition. While we observe a large increase in activity compared to groups studied in previous work, we did not see an increase in the amount of average daily learning sessions. However, we could identify a shift in learning times from working hours towards high attention periods in evenings and weekends. Consequently, we regard gamification as a means to raise user engagement, which yet bears challenges for the deployment in corporate environments to shape learning behavior as intended.},
